## 🧠 Research Focus  
My research lies at the intersection of **Generative AI**, **Vision-Language Models**, and **Image Editing**.  
I work on building models, datasets, and algorithms for:

- Multimodal generative modeling  
- Vision-language alignment  
- Image-conditioned instruction editing  
- 3D multi-view generation  
- Dataset creation for fine-grained image editing  

I have hands-on experience with LLaVA, BLIP-2 Q-Former features, GroundingDINO, SAM, diffusion models, and VLM-based editing pipelines.
